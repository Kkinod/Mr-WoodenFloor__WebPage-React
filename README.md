--------------------------

Website written in React, using styled components and TS.

I created this website to practice several elements, including:
- creating a website practically without using JS, i.e. mainly CSS, but in this case I used Styled Components
- all written from scratch, no external libraries (exception: slider)
- tests: unit, integration and E2E (work in progress)


To do:
- admin dashboard
- login
- create and connect to the site a small online store
